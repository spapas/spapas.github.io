    "much to be desired (when I first tried reading it I was overwhelmed by the amount of information there).\n",
    "\n",
    "A great introduction to pandas is the [three part series](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/) by Greg Reda - it touches `pivot_table` however I was only able to understand it properly *after* I played a lot with it. I don't know, maybe playing with `pivot_table` yourself (or being really experienced in such concepts) is the only way to properly comprehend it! To help with this journey however I'm going to try to explain various basic pandas concepts that will lead us to the `pivot_table` command (and some of its friends). Notice that I'm using pandas 0.18.1.\n",

I had to do some modifications to my theme to better integrate the notebook styling, however some stuff may not look as nice as the other articles. I have to mention that this integration is really great and I totally recommend it!"

    "The DataFrame\n",
    "=============\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important data structure that pandas uses is the [DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html). This can be thought as a two dimensional array, something like an Excel spreadsheet. In the pandas nomenclature, the rows of that two-dimensional array are called *indexes* (while the columns are still called *columns*) -- I'll either use rows or indexes for the rows of the DataFrame. The rows are called indexes because they can be used to ... index data (think of each column as a dictionary). However please notice that pandas has a different data structure named [Index](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Index.html) that is used to store the names of the headers (axis) of the rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we horizontally/vertically pick the values of a single row(index)/column we'll be left with a different data structure called [Series](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html) - this is more or less a single dimensional array (or a dictionary with the names of the columns/indexes as keys). There's also a [Panel](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Panel.html) data structure which is 3-dimensional, more like a complete Excel workbook (the third dimension being the individual sheets of the workbook) but I won't cover that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "More info on the above can be found on the corresponding [article about data structures](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways to read the data for a Series or DataFrame: Initializing through [arrays or dicts](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.from_records.html), [reading from csv](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.from_csv.html), [xls](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_excel.html), [database](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_sql_query.html), combinining series to create an array and various others. I won't go into any details about this but will include some examples on how to create Series and DataFrames. If you are familiar with python you can just convert everything to a dict and read that instead of researching individual methods."

    "Comprehending `pivot_table`\n",
    "=========================\n",
    "\n",
    "After this (rather long) introduction to using and manipulating DataFrames, the time has come to see `pivot_table`. The `pivot_table` method is applied to a DataFrame and its purpose is to \"reshape\" and \"aggregate\" the values of a DataFrame . More on reshaping can be found [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reshaping.html) and it means changing the indexes/columns of the DataFrame to create a new DataFrame that fits our needs. Aggregate on the other hand means that for each of the cells of the new DataFrame we'll create a summary of the data that should have appeared there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating a nice set of data we'll use for the `pivot_table` operations:"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The recommended type of input (at least by me) to the `pivot_table` is a simple DataFrame like the one I have already created:  Your index will be the `id` of your database (or you could even have an auto-generated index like in the example) and the columns will be the values you want to aggregate and reshape. This is very easy to create either by reading a file (xls/csv) or by a simple SQL query (substituting all foreign keys with a representative value). In the above example, we actually have the following columns: *author, genre, name, pages, year, decade, size* - this is a pool of data that will be very useful to remember for later and it is important to also keep it in your mind for your data. So, use a unique id as the index and remember the names of your columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see in the documentation, the [pivot_table method](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.pivot_table.html) uses four basic parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `index`: An array of the data that will be used as indexes to the resulting (i.e the reshaped and aggregated) DataFrame\n",
    "* `columns`: An array of the data that will be used as a columns to the resulting DataFrame\n",
    "* `values`: An array of the data whose values we want to aggregate in each cell\n",
    "* `aggfunc`: Which is the function (or functions) that will be used for aggregating the values\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how it actually works? You select a number of the headers from your pool of data and assign them to either `index` or `columns`, depending if you want to put them horizontally or vertically. Notice that both `index` and `columns`:\n",
    "* take either a string (to denote a single column) or an array to denote multiple columns\n",
    "* are optional (but you must define one of them) -- if you skip either columns or index you'll get a `Series` instead of a `DataFrame`\n",
    "* are interchangable (you can put any header from your pool to either index or columns, depending on how you want to display your data)\n",
    "* are mutually exclusive (you can't put the same header in both index and columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple data headers means that you'll have [hierachical indexes / columns](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/advanced.html) in your pivot (or `MultiIndex` as it's called - remember that `Index` is used to store the axis of the DataFrame), ie the rows/columns would be grouped by a hierarchy. Let's see an example of multiple indexes:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we used `'decade'` as an index, then the pivot_table index would be like \n",
    "* `70s` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "* `80s` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "* `90s` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "\n",
    "while, if we used `['decade', 'year']` we'd hove something like\n",
    "\n",
    "* `70s`\n",
    "    * `1975` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "    * `1978` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "* `80s`\n",
    "    * `1980` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "    * `1982` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "    * ...\n",
    "* `90s`\n",
    "    * `1990` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "    * ... \n",
    "    \n",
    "So, each year would automatically be grouped to its corresponing decade. The same would be true if we used `['decade', 'year']` in columns (but we'll now have a vertical grouping from top to bottom). Notice that pandas doesn't know if the values have any parent / child relationship but just goes from left to right (or top to bottom). For example, if we had used `['year', 'decade']`, we'd get something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `1975 70s'` value1 value2 ... \n",
    "* `1978 70s'` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "* `1980 80s'` value1 value2 ...\t\n",
    "* `1982 80s'` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, pandas doesn't care if the values of the hierarchical index are actually related. We could for example had selected a multi index of `['decade', 'size', 'genre']` that would  \n",
    "* display the list of decades at the left (or at the top if we used it as a column)\n",
    "* for each decade will display the sizes of the book of that decade at the center (header column or row) and finally\n",
    "* at the right header (or bottom correspondingly) will display the available genres for each size. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, since we have 3 values for each decade, 3 values for each size and 4 values for each genre in our dataset, each decade will appear 1 time (at the left), each size will appear 3 times (one for each decade) in the middle and each genre will appear 3x3 = 9(one for each combination of decade and size) times in the right. The total number of lines that our MultiIndex will contain is 3x3x4 = 36 (one line for each combination of decade/size/genre).\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope the above clarifies how index and columns are used to create the headers for rows and index of `pivot_table`. I will show some examples of various index and columns combinations but first, I'd like to talk about contents of the pivot table (since we've only talked about the headers of rows/columns until now).\n",
    "\n",
    "The values that the pivot_table will contain are defined through the other two parameters, `values` and `aggfunc`: We select one or more columns of the initial DataFrame through the `values` parameter and these are aggregated in the corresponding cell of the resulting dataframe using the aggfunc fuction, so for each cell as defined by index and column, pandas will pick the values that correspond to that cell and pass them to a function that will return the result (by combining these values). As can be understood, the values must be different than index and columns (so all three sets of values, index and columns must not intersect). By default, the `values` and `aggfunc` parameters may be ommited - this will result in using average as the function and selecting all numerical columns (that are not in indexes or columns of course) in the values.\n",

    "I know that this is difficult to understand so I'll give a simple example right away. Let's first create a nice set of data for our samples:"

    "As we can see we just passed `decade` as an index and `genre` as a column. We ommited `values` and `aggfunc` so the default values were used. What happened? Pandas created a new DataFrame that had the values of decade as its index and the values of genre as its columns. Now, for each of the values (remember that since we ommited values, pandas just gets all numerical data, i.e pages and year) it found the corresponding entries for each cell, got their average and put it in that cell. For example, since there are no Crime genre books in the 70's we got a `NaN` to both the pages and year values. However, there are two Horror books, with 823 and 439 pages so their average is 631. Notice that for each value a separate top-level multi-column containing all indexes and columns was created - we can display only pages or year by indexing with `['pages']` or `['year']`. We can think of each of the values columns as a seperate pivot table, so in the above example we have a pivot table for pages and a pivot table for year.\n",

For the pages and year we can understand what happens: For example, for the Horror novels of the 80's, the one with the minimal pages is Pet Sematery with 374 pages. The same has also the minimal year (1983).  However, the one with the minimal name is `It` (since `I` is before `P` it just compares strings). The author is the same for both(`Stephen King`) and the minimum size is medium (since `small (s) > medium (m)`). Of course we could pass the `values` parameter to actually define which values we wanted to see.\n",

    "* unstack: Pivot a level of the (necessarily hierarchical) index labels, returning a DataFrame having a new level of column labels whose inner-most level consists of the pivoted index labels. If the index is not a MultiIndex, the output will be a Series (the analogue of stack when the columns are not a MultiIndex). The level involved will automatically get sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "I must confess that I was not able to comprehend the above! A more easy explanation is that:\n",
    "* stack will re-arrange the values of the DataFrame so that the most inner column (the one at the bottom) will be converted to the most inner index (to the right)\n",
    "* unstack will do the exactly opposite: Re-arrange the values of the DataFrame so that the most inner index (the one at the right) will be converted to the most inner column (to the bottom)\n",
    "\n",
