    "(and quantity) of statistics in my applications. One method that has helped me much is the `pivot_table`\n",
    "command. This is a really (at least for me) complicated command that has\n",

    "Beyond this, this command is explained a little more in an article about \n",

    "much to be desired (when I first tried reading it I was overwhelmed by the amount of information there).\n",
    "\n",
    "A great introduction to pandas is the [three part series](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/) by Greg Reda - it touches `pivot_table` however I was only able to understand it properly *after* I played a lot with it. I don't know, maybe playing with `pivot_table` yourself (or being really experienced in such concepts) is the only way to properly comprehend it -- however I'm going to try to explain it a bit here in small steps.\n",

I have to mention that this integration is really great and I totally recommend it!"

    "The DataFrame\n",
    "=============\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important data structure that pandas uses is the [DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html). This can be thought as a two dimensional array, something like an Excel spreadsheet. In the pandas nomenclature, the rows of that two-dimensional array are called *indexes* (while the columns keep their name) -- I'll either use rows or indexes for the rows. However please notice that pandas has a different data structure named [Index](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Index.html) that is used to store the names of the headers (axis) of the rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we horizontally/vertically pick the values of a single row(index)/column we'll be left with a different data structure called [Series](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html) - this is more or less a single dimensional array. There's also a [Panel](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Panel.html) data structure which is 3-dimensional, more like a complete Excel workbook (the third dimension being the individual sheets of the workbook) but I won't cover that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "More info on the above can be found on the corresponding [article about data structures](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways to read the data for a Series or DataFrame: Initializing through [arrays or dicts](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.from_records.html), [reading from csv](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.from_csv.html), [xls](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_excel.html), [database](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_sql_query.html), combinining series to create an array and various others. I won't go into any details about this but will include some examples on how to create Series and DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing with more info on the `pivot_table` operation, I will list a number of examples as a quick reference on how to work with Series and DataFrames that will be useful in the rest of the article (and should be useful in general). Notice that I'm using pandas 0.18.1."

    "The recommended type of input (at least by me) to the `pivot_table` is a simple DataFrame like the one I have already created:  Your index will be the `id` of your database (or you could even have an auto-generated index like in the example) and the columns will be the values you want to create representations on. This is very easy to create either by reading a file (xls/csv) or by a simple SQL query (substituting all foreign keys with a representative value). In the above example, we actually have the following columns: *author, genre, name, pages, year, decade, size* - this is a pool of data that will be very useful to remember for later and it is important to also keep it in your mind for your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [pivot_table method](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.pivot_table.html) uses four basic parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `index`: An array of the data that will be used as indexes to the resulting DataFrame\n",
    "* `columns`: An array of the data that will be used as a columns to the resulting DataFrame\n",
    "* `values`: An array of the data whose values we want to aggregate in each cell\n",
    "* `aggfunc`: Which is the function (or functions) that will be used for aggregating the values\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how it actually works? You select a number of the headers from your pool of data and assign them to either `index` or `columns`, depending if you want to put them horizontally or vertically -- notice that both `index` and `columns` take either a string (to denote a single column) or an array to denote multiple columns, also both `index` and `columns` are optional (but you must define one of them). Multiple data headers means that you'll have [hierachical indexes / columns](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/advanced.html) in your pivot(or `MultiIndex` as it's called - remember that `Index` is used to store the axis of the DataFrame), ie the rows/columns would be grouped by a hierarchy. Please notice that the intersection of index and columns sets have to be an empty set (i.e you can't use the same data header in both). Let's see an example of multiple indexes:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we used `'decade'` as an index, then the pivot_table index would be like \n",
    "* `70s` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "* `80s` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "* `90s` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "\n",
    "while, if we used `['decade', 'year']` we'd hove something like\n",
    "\n",
    "* `70s`\n",
    "    * `1975` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "    * `1978` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "* `80s`\n",
    "    * `1980` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "    * `1982` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "    * ...\n",
    "* `90s`\n",
    "    * `1990` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "    * ... \n",
    "    \n",
    "So, each year would automatically be grouped to its corresponing decade. The same would be true if we used `['decade', 'year']` in columns (but we'll now have a vertical grouping from top to bottom). Notice that pandas doesn't know if the values have any parent / child relationship but just goes from left to right (or top to bottom). For example, if we had used `['year', 'decade']`, we'd get something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `1975 70s'` value1 value2 ... \n",
    "* `1978 70s'` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "* `1980 80s'` value1 value2 ...\t\n",
    "* `1982 80s'` value1 value2 ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, pandas doesn't care if the values of the hierarchical index are actually related. We could for example had selected a multi index of `['decade', 'size', 'genre']` that would display the list of decades at the left (or at the top if we used it as a column), for each decade will display the sizes of the book of that decade at the center and finally, at the right (or bottom correspondingly) will display the available genres for each size. So, since we have 3 values for each decade, 3 values for each size and 4 values for each genre in our dataset, each decade will appear 1 time (at the left), each size will appear 3 times (one for each decade) in the middle and each genre will appear 3x3 = 9(one for each combination of decade and size) times in the right. The total number of lines that our MultiIndex will be able to index is 3x3x4 = 36 (one line for each combination of decade/size/genre).\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope the above clears out how index and columns are used to create the headers for rows and index of `pivot_table`. I will show some examples of various index and columns combinations but first, I'd like to talk about the actual values that the pivot table will contain (since we've only talked about the headers of rows/columns until now).\n",
    "\n",
    "The values that the pivot_table will contain are defined through the other two parameters, `values` and `aggfunc`: We select one or more columns of the initial DataFrame through the `values` parameter and these are aggregated in the corresponding cell of the resulting dataframe using the aggfunc fuction -- for each index and column, we will pick the values correspond to that cell and pass them to a function that will return the result. that As can be understood, the values must be different than index and columns (so all three sets of values, index and columns must not intersect). By default, the `values` and `aggfunc` parameters may be ommited - this will result in using average as the function and selecting all numerical columns (that are not in indexes or columns of course) in the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that this is difficult to understand so I'll give a simple example right away. Let's say that we wanted to aggregate our books by their decade and genre:\n"

Pandas created a new DataFrame that had the values of decade as its index and the values of genre as its columns. Now, for each of the values (remember that since we ommited values, pandas just gets all numerical data, i.e pages and year) it found the corresponding entries for each cell, got their average and put it in that cell. For example, since there are no Crime genre books in the 70's we got a `NaN` to both the pages and year values. However, there are two Horror books, with 823 and 439 pages so their average is 631. The year column will also use the average, something that doesn't actually makes sense. So let's display only the pages:"

    "This is more interesting. It seems that since we didn't use the default aggfunc value but instead we passed our own (`min`), pandas did not use only the numerical values but used instead all remaining value columns: Remember that our pool of data was *author, genre, name, pages, year, decade, size*, the genre and decade were used as an index/column so the remaining headers were used as values: author, name, pages, year, size! For the pages and year we can understand what happens: For example, for the Horror novels of the 80's, the one with the minimal pages is Pet Sematery with 374 pages. The same has also the minimal year (1983).  However, the one with the minimal name is `It` (since `I` is before `P` it just compares strings). The author is the same for both(`Stephen King`) and the minimum size is medium (since `small (s) > medium (m)`). Of course we could pass the `values` parameter to actually define which values we wanted to see.\n",

    "* unstack: Pivot a level of the (necessarily hierarchical) index labels, returning a DataFrame having a new level of column labels whose inner-most level consists of the pivoted index labels. If the index is not a MultiIndex, the output will be a Series (the analogue of stack when the columns are not a MultiIndex). The level involved will automatically get sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "I must confess that I was not able to comprehend the above! A more easy explanation is that:\n",
    "* stack will re-arrange the values of the DataFrame so that the most inner column (the one at the bottom) will be converted to the most inner index (to the right)\n",
    "* unstack will do the exactly opposite: Re-arrange the values of the DataFrame so that the most inner index (the one at the right) will be converted to the most inner column (to the bottom)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, stack and unstack do not really make sense. It would be much easier (at least to me) if stack was named `col_to_idx` (or `col_to_row`) and unstack was named `idx_to_col` (`row_to_col`).\n",
